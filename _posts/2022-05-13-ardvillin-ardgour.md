preamble: |
  A welcome return to Ardvullin House in Ardgour, a short distance from the Corran Ferry slip, having last stayed here in August 2018. The house itself is a former ghillie’s cottage, dating from the 18th century. It’s worth a reminder that it is owned by the HopScotch children’s charity, which provides breaks for kids from challenging and stressful home environments, though the house is available for private lets, the funds from which, helping ensure they can continue their great work.

The weather was certainly an improvement on our previous visit, if a showery start, and, prior to checking-in on Friday, George and Susan went deep into the heart of Ardnamurchan to Dorlin and Castle Tioram for The Silver Walk

It’s an excellent wander, including a fair bit of height gain, and rewarded with fabulous views.  George and Susan’s walk also took in the Sub-2000, Beinn Bhreac.  Well worth a visit!

It’s amazing what a photo competition does to a person and beneath that rugged mountaineering exterior there’s a landscape photographer bursting to get out!…and the trees are a wee bit safer.

Lorn was late in setting off so but couldn’t have timed it better for a quick libation as, by the time he was ready to come off the ferry, Raymond and Jim A were just parking their bikes at the Ardgour Inn, having already dropped their gear off at Ardvullin. The majority were already firmly billeted in the house, though Duncan & Tina were to arrive in the wee sma’ hours.

It was a big weekend of football with the FA Cup Final and Play-off matches being followed thanks to Ardvullin’s WiFi and Jim L keeping everyone updated on developments. The house had certainly been spruced-up since the last visit and some of the kids games were enjoyed on Friday evening and the room was alive with fireside chat on the next day’s objectives.

With just light to moderate winds and the odd spot of rain forecast, folk were stirring fairly early, not long after Duncan and Tina had arrived in fact, following an epic journey! Saturday saw Raymond head for the Glengalmadale horseshoe, always a challenging circuit with a steep start on the Graham, Beinn na Cille, and leading to Fuar Beinn & Creach Beinn, both Corbetts, before a long walk out over the broad ridge back to the start. Not content with that, Raymond cycled to and from the start of the walk from Ardvullin so, this involved 20 miles on the bike and the 10 mile hike with a fair bit of ascent sandwiched between the out and back on the bike. In his own words his “legs were burst”!

A larger party, which included George, Susan, Jim A, Louise, John, Adrian and Ania, set off in search of the highest Corbett in the immediate area, Sgurr Dhomnhuill. They tackled this from the Ariundle Oakwoods at Strontian, a fine wee walk in itself and with the hill thrown in, it’s a fairly big day with rewarding views over much of Lochaber. This lot, along with Raymond, were doing their bit to ensure the club’s traditions as a mountaineering club were being maintained!

Meanwhile, Norrie was on a solo mission for the inaugural outing of the coffee & cake branch of the club, taking in Portuairk, Sanna and the Lighthouse along the way. Rumour has it, Norrie needed some quiet contemplation in order to plan the approach for his 3rd round of the Munros!

Unfortunately, Jim L wasn’t feeling his best and decided to head home earlier than intended. Hopefully Jim is on the mend and back at it in no time at all.

Duncan and Tina, after a long drive and late-night arrival, headed back over Fort William way and had a walk into Glen Nevis to the Steall Falls.
